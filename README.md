# VALORANT Agent Yoinker
A VALORANT tool for instalocking agents using the VALORANT API.

# How to Use
**MAKE SURE VALORANT IS OPEN BEFORE RUNNING AGENT YOINKER.** Launch VALORANT and then run the program. Enter your region and agent you want to instalock.

# Regions
The program will ask you for your region. The available regions are NA, EU, LATAM, BR, AP, KR, and PBE. Type the region that you play on.

# How it Works
Agent selecting is handled via the VALORANT API, which means that this program does not mess with the game's memory or files at all to select the agent. It just sends a request that an agent has been selected when in the pregame state.

# Is This Bannable?
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. With all programs like this, there is no guarantee that it's safe because using the VALORANT API in this manner is against Riot's Terms of Service. However, this program does not use an autoclicker to select the agent, read the game's memory, or change the game's files; therefore, the anticheat shouldn't be triggered. No suspensions have been reported so far from using this program. All things considered, I would use this only on alt accounta if you don't want to risk the 7 day API abuse suspension, albeit unlikely.
